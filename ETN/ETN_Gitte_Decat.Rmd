## introduction 

Biocypher is a unifying framework for biomedical knowledge graphs.
Biocypher was build to make the process of creating a biomedical knowledge graph easier, but still flexible and transparent.

1. Exploring code from Biocypher (adapter)

First, I looked up some information to get more insight of what  Biocypher exactly does. After this I looked for code that could help me understand what happens when an adapter is created. This code I found on the github page linked on the biocypher website. 
This is the link to the github page where i found the code:  https://github.com/HUBioDataLab/CROssBARv2/tree/main/bccb --> string_adapter.py

1. Exploring code from Biocypher (adapter)

I tried to understand this code and tried to run it in my virtual studio code. i came accros a few problems that i had to figure out. First of all i had to install Biocypher and create a poetry environment. In this environment i could run the script after i downloaded all the tools/packages that were needed and i did not have installed on my system yet. 

**Installation:** 

- Install pipx 

sudo dnf install pipx
pipx ensurepath

- Install poetry 

pipx install poetry

- Install biocypher via poetry 

create a environment and add biocyher there:
poetry new Biocypher_adapter
cd Biocypher_adapter
poetry add biocypher

Install packages: 

- Install bioregestry 

pip install bioregistry

- Install pypath

pip install pypath-omnipath
