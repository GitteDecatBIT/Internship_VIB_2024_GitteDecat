### Week 1

#### Monday 22/04/2024
##### Exploring code from Biocypher (adapter)\
First, I looked up some information to get more insight of what  Biocypher exactly does. After this I looked for code that could help me understand what happens when an adapter is created. This code I found on the github page linked on the biocypher website. 
https://github.com/HUBioDataLab/CROssBARv2/tree/main/bccb --> string_adapter.py

##### Creating and updating ETN:\
Start working ETN in Markdown


#### Tuesday 23/04/2024
###### Exploring code from Biocypher (adapter)\
I tried to understand this string_adapter.py code and tried to run it in my virtual studio code. i came accros a few problems that i had to figure out. First of all i had to install Biocypher and create a poetry environment. In this environment i could run the script after i downloaded all the tools/packages that were needed and did not have installed on my system yet. 
github: CROssBARv2/bccb/string_adapter.py

**Installation:** 

- Install pipx  --> sudo dnf install pipx, pipx ensurepath

- Install poetry --> pipx install poetry

- Install biocypher via poetry 
--> create a environment and add biocyher there:poetry new Biocypher_adapter, cd Biocypher_adapter, poetry add biocypher

**Install packages:**

- Install bioregestry --> pip install bioregistry

- Install pypath--> pip install pypath-omnipath
  
Problem: the script did not run completely, when running it it stops after a few step and give the prompt back 

#### Wednesday 24/04/2024
###### Exploring code from Biocypher (tutorial_adapter)\
On the biocypher website you can find a tutorial on how the scripts should work. i performed this tutorial on my system and looked at different scripts that are provided there. i tried to figure out how all the scripts are connected to each other. 
tutorial on github: Internship_VIB_2024_GitteDecat/Biocypher_tutorial/ project-template

###### Creating a workflow (creating a adapter)\
i started creating a workflow based on the tutorial. 

###### Creating github page\
Started to create my github page to collect all my data/information 

####Thursday 25/04/2024
##### Updated ETN\
i updated my ETN for the past days (22-23 april)

##### Creating a workflow (creating a adpater)\
i finished the first version of the workflow based on the tutorial 
workflow on github: Internship_VIB_2024_GitteDecat/Workflow/

##### Added everything to my github\ 
Added all the files i changed to my github 
Added new files to my github 

####Friday 25/04/2024
##### Updated ETN\
iupdated my ETN for the past days

##### IRefIndex code for biocypher\ 
i tried figuring out the code on how biocypher is performed and how the adapter is created, with this information i tried to create the code for the IRefIndex database

##### Run biocypher on Crossbar data\
i tried running biocypher with the crossbar data. i wanted to make sure that the code worked on my virtual studio code but i came across a few problems. 

Problem: 
try running crossbar --> could not import validation_class --> pypandtic and curies where not working together --> updated curies 
did not work

### Week 2

#### Monday 29/04/2024
##### Updated ETN\
i updated my ETN for the week before friday

##### Exploration of the Biogrid code from Crossbar\
I tried figuring out which columns i need to use from the IRefIndex database. I did this based on the code from the Biogrid database. 
github:Internship_VIB_2024_GitteDecat/Biocypher_IRefIndex

#### Tuesday 30/04/2024
##### Updated ETN\
i updated my ETN for the day before 

#### Write TDP\
i started writing my documentation plan for the 8 weeks of the traineeship 
github: Internship_VIB_2024_GitteDecat/ETN/

##### Creating an adapter file for IRefIndex\
I created a script that takes the columns you need as input for the adapter file. i tried adapting the biogrid_adapter file to make it work for irefindex 
github:Internship_VIB_2024_GitteDecat/Biocypher_IRefIndex


#### Wednesday 01/05/2024
#### Labour Day 
Day off

#### Thursday 02/05/2024
#### Submitted TDP (external supervisor)\
i send my  first version of the TDP to my external supervisor of VIB and he gave me some feedback
github: Internship_VIB_2024_GitteDecat/ETN/
#### Creating adapter file for IRefIndex\
I tried figuring out how to map the refseq accession number to the uniprot id ( using biogrid as a example)
