# Background information on the traineeship topic

??????

# TDP

Traineeship documentation plan (TDP)
Student: Gitte Decat 		Traineeship supervisor: Alexander Botzki 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tentative planning: 
During this traineeship I will work with Biocypher. Biocypher is created to retrieve information about certain interactions and create a knowledge graph. You can retrieve information about  gene-gene interactions, protein-protein interactions, gene-disease interactions, metabolic interactions and biological processes. With this information biocypher will create a visual representation of the complexes. 
To ben able to create a knowledge graph you need results from a database. Biocypher uses a collection of reusable “adapters” for different sources of biomedical knowledge. Due to the use of adapters a reproducible knowledge graph  can be created and shared for every specific task. 
VIB works with the database IRefIndex and would like to be able to use biocypher to create a knowledge graph. The problem is that there is not a adapter available for the IRefIndex database. In this adapter has to be defined where you can find specific information and what has to happen with that information. In particular they want to get information about the protein-protein interactions when creating the knowledge graph. 
These tasks will be performed during the traineeship from 22/04/2024 till 14/06/2024.
Data management 
All the information that is collected during this traineeship can be found in this github page: https://github.com/GitteDecatBIT/Internship_VIB_2024_GitteDecat.git
In this github repository you can find everything from tutorials, to a workflow and code that is written during the traineeship. The code will be created based on the tutorials that are given by biocypher itself and are find on the website. The github repository that includes the tutorial can be find here: https://github.com/biocypher/project-template.git
Next to the tutorials I will created the adapter file based on the adapter files that can be found in the CROssBARv2 github repository. In this repository, you can find multiple adapter files for various types of information. The adapter files that are created for Biogrid and stringdb fwill be used as an example to create the adapter file for IRefIdex, because there is some similarity between them. This will make it easier to understand the code/logic behind the adapter file. The github repository that includes the CROssBARv2 files can be find here: https://github.com/HUBioDataLab/CROssBARv2.git 


FAIR principles: 
-	Findable:
The data that is used comes from the IRefIndex database. This can be found on https://irefindex.vib.be/wiki/index.php/iRefIndex . In this database has each interactor a unique identifier and has metadata available. Further a key is generated for each protein interaction record and for each participant protein. 
At the end of the traineeship, a zip file will be created of the Internship_VIB_2024_GitteDecat github repository and will be given to VIB. 

-	Accessible: 
The iRefIndex database can be accessed via the following link:   https://irefindex.vib.be/wiki/index.php/iRefIndex . This is open and free and a PSI-MITAB tab-delimited format is used.

-	Interoperable: 
The iRefIndex data is available in PSI-MITAB 2.6 tab-delimited format.

-	Reusable: 
By providing well-structured, well-documented, and openly accessible protein-protein interaction data is IRefIndex reusable and can be integrated with other databases and tools.

Traceability of steps and methods
The ETN with the project steps can be found on the same github page as mentioned before. Everyday the different steps that were performed are documented in the markdown file called ETN_Gitte_Decat.Rmd. 
Version control of code
The status of my github is set on public, so that the github page is available for everyone. At the end of the traineeship, a zip file will be created from the github repository and this will uploaded/send to the traineeship supervisor from VIB and shared with Howest.




# Learning outcome 
Learning outcome (LO)
Student: Gitte Decat 		Traineeship supervisor: Alexander Botzki 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Development goal: 
Improve my Python coding skills and understanding the logic behind the codes. Along with understanding how all the scripts used in Biocypher are connected to each other. This also means understanding what every package/library does and where the information comes from. 

Development activity 
I will be working with biocypher and the IRefIndex database during this traineeship. The goal is to provide VIB with an adapter file for IRefIndex that can be used with Biocypher. I have to do a lot of research on how these adapters are formulated. They use the packages pypath and this is new to me, so I have to analyse all the components that can be find in this packages and where to use it/ adapt it for me use. 
At last I should be in contact with a person from Biocypher to let them know that I might have an extra adapter that can be used with Biocypher. These people should than look at my code and say if it is correct and if they even want to include to Biocypher and make it available for other users.

Desired results
At the endof the traineeship I would like to be able to write a Python script (adapter file) that makes it able to use IRefIndex in Biocypher.

Schedule 
These activities will be performed during the traineeship from 22/04/2024 till 14/06/2024.

Necessary support and facilities 
To obtain my goal I will need my traineeship working hours and learning materials such as the IREfIndex database and the Biocypher website that includes: information about the concept, tutorials and the CROssBAR project. 

SMART principles 
Specific: Creating an python script to be able to use IRefIndex together with Biocypher.
Measurable:  At the end of the traineeship I should be able to use the adapter file for IRefindex together with Biocypher and create a knowledge graph. 
Achievable:  With the time and help I can get at VIB I should be able to create the adapter file. 
Relevant: In the context of the traineeship, this learning outcome can be considered relevant.  
Time-bound: This learning outcome should be completed by the end of the traineeship. 



# ETN

## Github
Github page where you can find all the data/info that is discussed in this ETN : https://github.com/GitteDecatBIT/Internship_VIB_2024_GitteDecat.git

### Week 1

#### Monday 22/04/2024
##### Exploring code from Biocypher (adapter)\
First, I looked up some information to get more insight of what  Biocypher exactly does. After this I looked for code that could help me understand what happens when an adapter is created. This code I found on the github page linked on the biocypher website. 
https://github.com/HUBioDataLab/CROssBARv2/tree/main/bccb --> string_adapter.py

##### Creating and updating ETN:\
Start working ETN in Markdown


#### Tuesday 23/04/2024
###### Exploring code from Biocypher (adapter)\
I tried to understand this string_adapter.py code and tried to run it in my virtual studio code. i came accros a few problems that i had to figure out. First of all i had to install Biocypher and create a poetry environment. In this environment i could run the script after i downloaded all the tools/packages that were needed and did not have installed on my system yet. 
github: CROssBARv2/bccb/string_adapter.py

**Installation:** 

- Install pipx  --> sudo dnf install pipx, pipx ensurepath

- Install poetry --> pipx install poetry

- Install biocypher via poetry 
--> create a environment and add biocyher there:poetry new Biocypher_adapter, cd Biocypher_adapter, poetry add biocypher

**Install packages:**

- Install bioregestry --> pip install bioregistry

- Install pypath--> pip install pypath-omnipath
  
Problem: the script did not run completely, when running it it stops after a few step and give the prompt back 

#### Wednesday 24/04/2024
###### Exploring code from Biocypher (tutorial_adapter)\

github:Internship_VIB_2024_GitteDecat/Biocypher_IRefIndex


### Week 3

#### Monday 06/05/2024
##### Create adapter file based on biocypher tutorial\
I tried creating the adapter file based on the tutorial from biocypher, to have a script that works. I try to run the adapter file based on the Crossbar files --> it does not work. Therefore i went back to an more easier example to take as a base. 
i added some parts from the crossbar based file to make it more specific for IRefIndex 
##### Updated ETN\ 
Updated ETN for the this day 

#### Tuesday 07/05/2024
##### Create adapter file based on biocypher tutorial\
I tried including the input from the IRefIndex database. With the structure of the tutorial it is possible to run the scripts and create output. but the output does not overlap with the input from irefindex. In the tutorial they just take random ids, labels and so on... this needs to be adjusted for the irefindex input. 
i also added some logger functions to make it clear for myself what happens as what time. 

#### Wednesday 08/05/2024
##### Create adapter file based on biocypher tutorial\
I was able to include the input from the IRefIndex database. With the structure of the tutorial it is possible to run the scripts and create output.
