## ETN

## Week 1

###### Exploring code from Biocypher (adapter)
First, I looked up some information to get more insight of what  Biocypher exactly does. After this I looked for code that could help me understand what happens when an adapter is created. This code I found on the github page linked on the biocypher website. 
This is the link to the github page where i found the code:  https://github.com/HUBioDataLab/CROssBARv2/tree/main/bccb --> string_adapter.py

###### Exploring code from Biocypher (adapter)
I tried to understand this string_adapter.py code and tried to run it in my virtual studio code. i came accros a few problems that i had to figure out. First of all i had to install Biocypher and create a poetry environment. In this environment i could run the script after i downloaded all the tools/packages that were needed and did not have installed on my system yet. 

**Installation:** 

- Install pipx  --> sudo dnf install pipx, pipx ensurepath

- Install poetry --> pipx install poetry

- Install biocypher via poetry 
--> create a environment and add biocyher there:poetry new Biocypher_adapter, cd Biocypher_adapter, poetry add biocypher

**Install packages:**

- Install bioregestry --> pip install bioregistry

- Install pypath--> pip install pypath-omnipath

Problem: the script did not run completely, when running it it stops after a few step and give the prompt back

###### Exploring code from Biocypher (tutorial_adapter)
On the biocypher website you can find a tutorial on how the scripts should work. i performed this tutorial on my system and looked at different scripts that are provided there. i tried to figure out how all the scripts are connected to each other. 
###### Creating github page
Started to create my github page to collect all my data/information
