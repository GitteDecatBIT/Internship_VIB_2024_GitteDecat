# Internship_VIB_2024_GitteDecat

In this github repository you can find all the scripts that are made during my traineeship by VIB at Zwijnaarde.

The purpose of my traineeship is to create an adapter file for the IRefIndex database to be able to create a knowledge graph using biocypher.  

## Biocypher: 

BioCypher is the simplest way to create an AI-enabled knowledge graph for biomedical (or other) tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) are an approach to knowledge representation that uses graph structure to facilitate exploration and analysis of complex data.
